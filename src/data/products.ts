    description:
      "The Travis Scott x Nike Air Force 1 Low “Cactus Jack” is Scott’s intentionally rough-and-tumble reimagining of the revered silhouette. The patchwork design calls to mind Nike’s Bespoke Design Lab formerly located in downtown Manhattan for its sewn-together, DIY-inspired ethos. Scott outfits his second Air Force 1 Low collaboration with sturdy canvas patches that include shades of brown, lilac, dark navy blue, and black along the upper. A brown canvas Swoosh is located on each lateral side with a camo Swoosh on each medial side. Scott's 'Cactus Jack' graphics can be found printed across various panels of the upper. A black leather perforated toe contrasts the canvas, as does a unique black corduroy and blue nylon lace cover with a large gold zipper running down the middle. The medial side of the shoe also sports mismatched canvas with a tan buckle covering the heel. A cream midsole with a gum outsole completes the look",

This model is part of the initial release that was sold exclusively in the Chicago area in an edition of 2,300 individually numbered pairs.

      "The adidas Yeezy Boost 700 MNVN “Blue Tint” is a Summer 2021 release of the retro-inspired “dad shoe” by Kanye West that continues the silhouette’s association with head-turning color blocking. The Yeezy 700 MNVN is one of four variations of the model and the only 700 to feature a branding and a no-sewn overlay design. As for the “Blue Tint,” adidas dresses the nylon upper in an icy light blue hue and places reflective “700” branding to either side that shines when exposed to light in the dark. Other details include a no-tie bungee lacing system and reflective black and grey panels on the toe and heel. The aforementioned details give the 700 MNVN a more progressive look when compared to early 700 releases. Adidas’s responsive Boost cushioning is embedded within the chunky black midsole.
